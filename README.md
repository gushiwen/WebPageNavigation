# Web Page Navigation
In this exercise, I leverage Bootstrap Navbar on index.html,
route and fetch data to update the content of the page.<br/>

I fetch data asychronously and only update specified section,
to avoid refreshing the whole page.<br/>

I also apply dynamic color effect to differentiate clicked link and others.
